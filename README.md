# BattleShips
In this project, you created a game of battleships using JavaScript. The game allows players to place their ships on a grid, with the option to place them horizontally or vertically. The ships are randomly placed on the grid and have unique names.

Players take turns dropping bombs on the grid, trying to sink their opponent's ships. The game keeps track of which player sinks all of their opponent's ships first, and declares the winner.

Overall, this project is a fun and interactive way to play the classic game of battleships, all powered by JavaScript.
